**The work is currently under review. The corresponding code will be published upon publication of the paper.**
From the Robotics Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
# What will be released
We will release the full code of a fast graph-based sensor fusion approach. The steps needed to reproduce the results as shown in the paper will be detailed.
