**The work is accepted to ICRA 2022. The corresponding code will be made publicly available in May 2022.**
From the Robotics Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
# What will be released
We will release the full code of a fast graph-based sensor fusion approach. The steps needed to reproduce the results of the paper will be detailed in the instructions.
